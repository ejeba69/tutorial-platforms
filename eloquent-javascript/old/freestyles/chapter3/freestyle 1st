For me, I sense a natural connection between the concept of function in Mathematics and JavaScript.
let y = f(x) 
is very similar to 
let y = function(x) {
	block of code
}
This connection is really exciting to me. And it's helping to better appreciate the concept of function in JavaScript.


let square = function(x) {
	console.log(x * x);
};
square(3);


let x
if (x = 0) {
	return "fuck y0u!"
} else if (x = 7) {
	return "perfect"
} else {
	return "true love"
}
x=0
console.log(x)


let ten = 10
let tenSquared = ten * ten
console.log(tenSquared)


//EXPONENT FUNCTION
let e = function (base, power) {
	let counter = 0;
	let result = 1;
	while (counter < power) {
		result *= base;
		counter++
	}
	return result
}
console.log(e(7, 2));


//EXPONENT FUNCTION USING FOR LOOP
let e = function (base, power) {
	let result = 1;
	for (let counter=0; counter < power; counter++) {
		result *= base;
	}
	return result
}
console.log(e(5, 3))


//ARITHMETIC SERIES
let s = function (initTerm, commonDiff, lastTerm) {
	let term = initTerm;	//let term be initialized to the value of initTerm
	let sum = 0;	//let sum be initialized to Zero
	do {
		sum += term;
		term += commonDiff;
	} while (term <= lastTerm)
	return sum;
};
console.log(s(6, 3, 23))

//Ways of expressing functions:
//let y = function (x) {}
//let y = (x) => {}
//function y(x) {}


//EXPONENT FUNCTION USING FOR LOOP
function e (base, power) => {
	let result = 1;
	for (let counter=0; counter < power; counter++) {
		result *= base;
	}
	return result
